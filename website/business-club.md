### Consultancy services.

IMADA has different world-renown expert in fields such as data science, AI,
Machine Learning, Mathematics, Programming, Algorithms, Software Development,
and Bioinformatics. Through DIO it is possible to access these expertise on
consultancy bases.

### Project Day in Computer Science

DIO organize an annually meeting where companies and IMADA students have the
opportunity to network and discuss possible study work, internship, or project
collaborations. Companies are invited to present their activities and some of
the challenges that they are facing to trigger the dialog and the brainstorm
activity.

### Stand at the Career Day

IMADA Career Day is a traditional and successful half day event where IMADA
alumni working in companies present and talk about their transition from study
to work, their experiences, and the challenges that they overcame. Afterwards,
the companies have the opportunities to have one to one meetings with students
on work on career prospective.

### Post Education

IMADA is well known for its teaching. Based on the companies demands, advance
and target courses will be offered and adapted to the companies needs (e.g.,
Microservice Programming, DevOps, Deep Learning, Python Programming).

### Company bus tour stop

Following IMADA tradition, once a year we organize a tour where students are
brought to visit 3-5 companies, so companies can better present themselves
directly at their headquarters, showing their facilities and introducing some of
their employees. 

### SDU Talent Fellowship

SDU Talent Fellowship is a unique opportunity for companies to be matched with
foreign master students for a study job (12 hours per week) at the company. The
Fellowship is designed to provide the student a direct access to the company and
give the insights into what is going on in the technology industry. More details
are available
[here](https://www.sdu.dk/en/uddannelse/kandidat/datalogi/jobmuligheder/talentfellowship).


### Business Profiling at IMADA

The company has the possibility to profile itself with a logo at the business
partner wall.

### Newsletter

The DIO Newsletter will be used to send out important information and news
connected to the DIO activities and summarizing what is going on at IMADA
currently.
